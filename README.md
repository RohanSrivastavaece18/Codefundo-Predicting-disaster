# Codefundo-Predicting-Limnic-Eruption

A limnic eruption, also termed a lake overturn, is a rare type of natural disaster in which dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) suddenly erupts from deep lake waters, forming a gas cloud capable of suffocating wildlife, livestock, and humans.

On 21 August 1986, one of the strangest and most mysterious natural disasters in history took place at Lake Nyos - a lake formed atop a volcanic crater in northwest Cameroon.

Without warning, the lake released hundreds of thousands of tonnes of toxic carbon dioxide - estimates range from 300,000 to up to 1.6 million - and this silent death cloud spread out over the countryside at nearly 100 km/h (62 mph), suffocating an estimated 1,746 people and more than 3,500 livestock within minutes.

Detection of CO2 in Water :
1 . Fill the plastic measuring tube level full with the water to be tested. Transfer to the mixing bottle by placing the mixing         bottle over the tube and then turning the bottle right-side up.
2 . Add one drop of phenolphthalein indicator to the mixing bottle.
3 . Add sodium hydroxide solution drop by drop.
4 . Each drop sodium hydroxide used equals 5 mg/l carbon dioxide.

Other Way to detect Limnic eruption is to use Infrared Sensors to check the level of CO2 in atmosphere.
When light passes through a gas stream containing carbon dioxide, the gas absorbs energy from
the light at specific wavelengths. The remaining light is filtered to a wavelength specific to
carbon dioxide. The amount of light remaining at the specific wavelength is measured. The
amount of light absorbed is directly proportional to the amount of carbon dioxide present in the
gas stream.

Thus, we can train a few people in every village from where lakes are present regarding the detection measures stated above , since they are economical it won't be tough for them to impement it. Also each and every factory which dispose off their effluents in lakes must be ordered to have a proper setup of the above mechanism through which a continous analysis on the lakes can be carried out.
